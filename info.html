            <!-- q1 -->
            <h4>Q: How do fueled cars' internal combustion engines operate?</h4>
            <p>Ans: An internal combustion engine (ICE) in a gasoline-powered car operates by burning a mixture of
                fuel and air within the engine's cylinders to produce mechanical power.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intake Stroke: The process begins with the intake valve opening, allowing a mixture of air and
                    fuel to enter the cylinder. In modern engines, fuel injectors introduce fuel either into the
                    intake manifold or directly into the combustion chamber, where it mixes with air.</li>
                <li>Compression Stroke: The intake valve closes, and the piston moves upward, compressing the
                    air-fuel mixture. Compressing the mixture increases its temperature and pressure, making it more
                    volatile and ready for efficient combustion.</li>
                <li>Power Stroke: At the peak of the compression stroke, a spark plug emits a spark that ignites the
                    compressed air-fuel mixture. The resulting combustion rapidly increases pressure within the
                    cylinder, forcing the piston downward. This downward motion is the primary source of the
                    engine's power, as it turns the crankshaft and ultimately drives the vehicle's wheels.</li>
                <li>Exhaust Stroke: After the power stroke, the exhaust valve opens, and the piston moves upward
                    again, expelling the combustion gases from the cylinder through the exhaust system. This
                    prepares the cylinder for the next cycle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Q: How do fuel-powered vehicles affect the environment?
                Statistics about the environmental impact of gasoline-powered vehicles:</h4>
            <p>Ans: Fuel-powered automobiles significantly impact the environment, primarily through the
                emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous
                oxide (N₂O). These emissions contribute to climate change and air pollution.
                <br /> Environmental Impact:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO₂
                    annually, depending on fuel type, fuel economy, and miles driven. Burning one gallon of
                    gasoline produces approximately 8,887 grams of CO₂.</li>
                <li>Contribution to Climate Change: In the European Union, transport accounts for about 25% of
                    total CO₂ emissions, with road transport comprising 71.7% of that share. Notably, transport
                    is the only sector where GHG emissions have increased over the past three decades, rising by
                    33.5% between 1990 and 2019.</li>
            </ul>
            Solutions to Mitigate Environmental Impact:
            <ul>
                <li>Enhance Fuel Efficiency: Improving the fuel economy of conventional vehicles reduces fuel
                    consumption and CO₂ emissions. Technological advancements and regulatory standards have led
                    to better fuel efficiency and lower emissions in recent years.</li>
                <li>Implement Stringent Emission Standards: Regulations that set CO₂ emission performance
                    standards for new passenger cars and vans can drive manufacturers to produce cleaner
                    vehicles. The EU has such regulations in place to help reduce emissions from road transport.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <!-- q3 -->
            <h4>Q: How do the engines in electric automobiles operate?</h4>
            <p>Ans: Electric vehicles (EVs) run on an electric motor powered by energy stored in a battery
                pack.
            <ul>
                <li>Energy Storage: EVs use a huge traction battery pack to store electrical energy. This
                    battery is charged by connecting the car to an external power source via the charge
                    port.</li>
                <li>Power Conversion: To charge the battery, the onboard charger converts the external power
                    supply's alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). A DC/DC converter also
                    converts the traction battery's high-voltage DC into lower-voltage DC, which is then
                    used to operate vehicle accessories and recharge the auxiliary battery.</li>
                <li>Electric Motor Operation: The traction battery powers the electric traction motor,
                    which drives the vehicle's wheels. Unlike internal combustion engines, electric motors
                    may provide instant torque.</li>
                <li>Power Management: A power electronics controller regulates the flow of electrical energy
                    from the battery to the motor, controlling the vehicle's speed and torque in response to
                    driver inputs.</li>
                <li>Regenerative Braking: Many EVs have regenerative braking systems, which catch kinetic
                    energy during deceleration and transform it back into electrical energy to recharge the
                    battery, increasing overall efficiency.</li>
                <li>Thermal Management: A thermal system ensures that the battery, motor, and other
                    components operate at ideal temperatures, resulting in efficiency and longevity.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Q: How do electric automobiles affect the environment?
                Statistics about the environmental impact of electric cars:
            </h4>
            <p>Ans: Electric vehicles (EVs) offer significant environmental benefits compared to traditional
                internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Here are some key statistics and rates
                highlighting their impact:
                <br><br>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
            <ul>
                <li>Electricity Source Influence: The environmental advantage of EVs is more pronounced when
                    they are charged using renewable energy sources. In regions where electricity generation
                    relies heavily on fossil fuels, the benefits are reduced but still present.</li>
            </ul>
            Battery Production Impact:
            <ul>
                <li>Manufacturing Emissions: While the manufacturing process of EVs, particularly battery
                    production, can be resource-intensive, the overall lifecycle emissions remain lower than
                    those of ICE vehicles.</li>
            </ul>
            Air Quality and Health Benefits:
            <ul>
                <li>Zero Tailpipe Emissions: EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, leading to improved air
                    quality and reduced health issues related to air pollution, such as respiratory problems
                    and cardiovascular diseases.</li>
            </ul>
            Energy Efficiency:
            <ul>
                <li>Higher Efficiency: EVs are more energy-efficient than ICE vehicles, converting a higher
                    percentage of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels. This
                    efficiency contributes to lower overall energy consumption and reduced environmental
                    impact.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <!-- conclusion -->
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>While the production of EVs, especially their batteries, involves substantial resource
                consumption and emissions, the overall environmental impact of EVs is significantly lower
                than that of traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. This advantage is further enhanced
                when EVs are powered by renewable energy sources, underscoring the importance of integrating
                clean energy with the adoption of electric mobility.</p>
